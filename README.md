## Run instructions
- npm install

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
> As you start the game, you will see that Flappy already appears on the screen. The first exercise is to let Flappy flutter its wings.
> To do that, you must extend the use of the picture 'flap.png'. 
> Switch every x milliseconds (using the interval from the update-method) to another image of Flappy to simulate the fluttering.
